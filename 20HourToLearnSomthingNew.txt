Professor at Florida State University (K. Anderson Ericsson) is the originator of the 10,000 hour rule
5 years but it referst to ultra competitive folks in ultra-high performance fields.
And he tried to figure out how long does it take to get to the top of those kinds of fields.
 - The more deliberate practice (10,000 hours of practice)

Malcolm Gladwell <book -> Outliers: The Story of Success (2007)>
The central piece of that book is the 10.000 rule 

The Thelepone game:
It takes 10.000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field.
It takes 10.000 hours to become an expert at something
It takes 10.000 hours to become good at something
It takes 10.000 hours to learn something

The studies of skills aquicition implies that at the beginning is to difficult and later on
time it will be easy.

20 Hours is enough to cross the barrier: 
(Practice Intelligently/efficiently)
-> 4 simple steps to rapis skill acquisition
1. Deconstruct the skill -> Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done.
 -> An then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces
2. Learn enougn to self-correct (Get three to five resources about what you're trying to learn)
3.Remove practice barriers. (Distractions, TV/Internet)
4.Practice for at least 20 hours

The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't intellectual... it's emotional
